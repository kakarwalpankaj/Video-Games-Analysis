### About the project ###

This project is a guided project from DataCamp (i.e. the data is already prepared and ready to use). The project is about analyzing and getting insights about video games sales, and users and critics reviews. The project's main goal is to answer some questions and get insights about the world of video games with the help of these answers.

### The project is divided into 4 phases ###  
    
    These visualizations have shown me some insights:
            
    + Most games are created by __Nintendo__ and __Playstation__ platforms
    + For most of the years, users' average score are less than critics' average score
    + According to the number of games created, the era of evolution is between __2000__ and __2015__
    + In many years, __Nintendo__ has the same (or more) number of games as __Playstation__ in spite of the more number of developers who work for __Playstation__ (approximately the double)
    + For the last 20 years, __Atari__ and __GEN__ platforms are disappeared
    + The top 10 developers (out of 133) have created more than 37% of the total created
